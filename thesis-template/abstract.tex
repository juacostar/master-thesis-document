\chapter{Abstract}
Software engineering involves different efforts with the same purpose: high-quality software development. Among these efforts, we can find the software architecture definition process, which gives preference to the various quality attributes according to the system's needs. However, for different reasons, the solution development can deviate from the original architecture design; it could generate performance problems, and as a consequence, it affects the user experience. This impact on software quality could be represented, at a greater rate, in a mobile environment due to its limited resources. Previous research with this approach has focused on problem study and detection in different areas like security, connectivity, etc. However, in mobile development, the concept of "architectural erosion" has not been deeply studied. The main goal of this research project is to detect and locate architectural erosion bugs in mobile applications with automated static and dynamic analysis based on deep learning models.
