\chapter{Conclusions and Future Work}
\label{cha:conclusions}
We have explored mainly the problem of AER issues, focused on Android applications. We identified the problem and the suggested solutions in other software engineering areas and defined some research questions to explore this phenomenon in the Android environment. After that, we implemented and suggested some solution approaches, identified and adapted them into the Android context. For every solution approach, we analyzed and compared some results according to the experiments mentioned in the related work. Finally, we defined alternatives to extend the implemented methodologies for AER issues identification. Those alternatives are related to other quality attributes in software architecture and issues found in specific layers of any architecture (like the UI layer of any Android project). Finally, with this work, we can define a conclusion related to the main scope of the research and the defined research question.

\section{Research Questions conclusions}

\begin{itemize}
	\item  \textbf{How can we identify Architectural Erosion in Android apps?} Architectural erosion can be identified in different ways. The most well-known identification methodologies of AER are powered by static code analysis tools and the use of AI models and NLP techniques. With these methodologies, we can identify some issues and architectural violations related to one or more architectural guidelines and standards. For AER issues in Android applications, we can identify them with code analysis of the source code of any Android project. We can identify any issue with custom lint check rules or the evaluation of some AI model with code issues detection as a learning task.
	
	\item  \textbf{What methodologies can we use to detect AER in Android apps?} The research focused on two methodologies for AER issues identification. The first methodology explored the use of static code analysis techniques. It consists of an analysis of a set of GitHub commits of a set of Android applications. Some issues were detected in a process of manual tagging by two judges with experience in Android development. A set of patterns was extracted according to the identified architectural smells and issues during the manual tagging. The custom lint check rules were implemented in the Android Studio linter and were tested with some applications, generating warnings and error reports, and using the linter to identify architectural violations. The second explored methodology employs AI models and NLP techniques, using static and dynamic word embedding models to identify potential keywords inside GitHub commit messages that could indicate an AER issue in the implemented code of the commit. Different word embedding models were analyzed and compared to get better performance, and the words with the highest semantical meaning in the context of AER. Furthermore, we explored the use of AI models to make a fine-tuning process related to the AER issues identification learning task. We tested the model's results with another set of commits and the use of an AI agent to evaluate the accuracy of the model. Finally, the implemented methodologies for AER issues in Android apps showed a good performance in Android projects and could be useful for the identification of issues related to specific quality attributes.
	
	\item \textbf{How effective are the proposed methodologies?} The implemented methodologies for AER issues identification were tested in different ways. The methodology based on static code analysis techniques was tested with two applications, one of which includes some anti-patterns in terms of the architectural guidelines for Android projects. The second tested application was one of the selected set of applications for the GitHub commits extraction. In the case of both applications, the created custom lint check rules generated reports and warnings in the IDE during the development stage, showing good performance. With the created custom lint check rules, we see the opportunity to create more with a deeper search of architectural smells inside the large set of explored commits. The effectiveness of the second solution methodology was compared with the use of another AI model testing approaches, a manual tagging process, and the use of AI agents. The results of the testing stage were prominent, with a good performance in the manual tagging and a growth opportunity for the evaluation implemented with the AI agent. In general, the effectiveness of the solution methodologies for AER issues identification allows extending this research topic and exploring more methodologies related to architecture guidelines and the different quality attributes.

\end{itemize}

According to the answers to the research questions, it is possible to analyze and compare the results obtained from every solution methodology. We defined a set of results and conclusions according to the testing stage of every methodology. 


\section{Conclusions of explored methodologies}

\subsection{Static Code Analysis techniques}
There are some important results related to the development of custom lint check rules for AER issue identification. The built tool for the research scope showed advantages for AER issues:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Static code analysis is very important to identify patterns of different kinds in terms of any programming language components. We can use this approach to identify any issues or insights related to any specific pattern during the development stage. The use of custom lint check rules could support the validation of different rules and standards of different frameworks.
	\item For Android applications, we can use custom lint check rules to detect customized patterns according to any defined pattern in the design stage during the software development cycle. Based on the tools and solutions mentioned in the related work, we can adapt them to solve customized issues in source code fragments of any Android project.
	\item It is possible to combine different solution approaches to improve the performance of static code analysis techniques. The use of NLP techniques and word similarity metrics could be useful to identify patterns and implement them with custom lint check rules. This approach could be improved with the current tools of AI models and NLP techniques.
	\item Static code analysis must be a very important step in the testing and maintenance stages of the software development cycle. The detection of general and customized lint check rules could improve the code performance and the sustainability of any software project. For Android projects, it could improve the costs of development, testing, and maintenance. Use of static code analysis techniques in Android projects would improve the user experience, detecting different issues and patterns in different layers of the application.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{NLP techniques and AI models}
Current tools of AI and NLP can improve at a high scale for detecting anti-patterns and identifying AER issues. The use of static and dynamic word embedding models, AI models, and AI agents defined a complete tool suite to explore different insights inside the source code fragments of Android projects.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Both static and dynamic word embedding models can be useful for identifying potential keywords in GitHub commits from Android projects. Static word embedding models rely on the training context, and when trained within a software development domain, they can yield more accurate results by uncovering new keywords related to quality attributes in Android applications. To measure similarity, the cosine similarity metric proves effective, as its averaged values can highlight semantically related words within a given context. On the other hand, dynamic word embedding models, often derived from advanced AI architectures, offer an even more powerful approach for detecting new keywords. Their training process allows them to adapt to specific contexts, making them well-suited for both classification tasks and the generation of new data.
	
	\item The use of AI models powered by NLP techniques could improve the detection of different issues with a correct training stage. Furthermore, the fine-tuning of AI models related to the detection of code smells as a learning task could detect in an early stage any architectural smell and identify AER issues.
	
	\item AI agents are useful as judges in the testing stage. AI agents can connect with LLMs at a high rate of processing and accuracy in terms of the detection of issues in any programming language. AI agents could be extended to make a connection with little or simplified models to get good processing and responses with a low rate of consumption of resources.
	
	\item NLP techniques are very important to detect words with a high semantic value related to any specific context. With processes like stemming, lemmatizing, and stop word removal, it is possible to find potential keywords that could represent any issue in any specific context. Since the context of versioning platforms of software like GitHub, to the context of reviews in any marketplace of applications, it is possible to measure the semantic value of any word to detect an issue in any project. Focused on Android projects, the use of AI and NLP could extract issues related to the user experience provided by the application. Current AI models will achieve the quality of code and sustainability of any Android project.

\end{itemize}


We observed prominent results with the implementations of every solution methodology for AER issues identification. With a combination of both methodologies, we can improve the identification process and generate optimal solutions to any identified AER issues in the source code of any Android project. Furthermore, with the mentioned methodologies extensions, we can define a prominent future work with a growth opportunity for the detection of any issues related to general or specific quality attributes. The main objective is to extend not only in the Android development environment, but extend them to the identification of issues of any software project based on different architectural patterns and guidelines, and written with any programming language.


\section{Future Work}
In the extensions section, we defined initial steps to use the studied methodologies for AER issues identification to detect issues for any quality attribute, specifically for usability issues. Using the generated commit dataset, it is possible to train machine learning models to evaluate various metrics related to the detection of architectural erosion (AER) issues, with a specific focus on Android application development. Additionally, large language models (LLMs) such as CodeReviewer, CodeT5, trained for code issue detection and high-performance code generation, can be adapted to tasks such as instruction-based code generation, providing feedback on input code, and producing optimized versions of the source code \cite{codereviewer,codebert,codet5}.
Based on the results obtained from implementing static word embedding models, it appears that dynamic word embeddings—integrated into large language models (LLMs) trained for software analysis and generation—may offer improved effectiveness. Models such as CodeReviewer and CodeBERT, which leverage dynamic embeddings, can more accurately identify semantically meaningful keywords in commit messages, particularly those associated with architectural erosion (AER) issues in source code. By utilizing these models and their ability to capture contextual semantics, it becomes feasible to generate code that adheres more closely to architectural guidelines and standards. While AI systems are already capable of producing complete software projects, incorporating mechanisms for issue detection could significantly enhance the quality and robustness of the generated software.
Nowadays, there are many AI models and trained word embedding models for different training tasks. Using these models can improve the quality of the software development process. It is possible to extend the implemented methodology to learning tasks in Large Language Models (LLMs). Creating AI agents for keyword detection of specific quality attributes. This research could help analyze large amounts of data in Android projects to evaluate architecture quality. These solutions could decrease cost in any software project. It is essential to leverage process optimizations at every stage of software development. The use of AI and NLP could ensure better development quality and adherence to standards and policies for a specific architecture \cite{future_work1,future_work2}.
